## Progress up until this point
### Week one: The idea for the project was conceptualized and pitched to my instructor.
### Week two: The visual concepts were developed, and I created the basic layout of the project in Figma.
### Week three: The Structural layout of the project was madde in the design document. This was also when I fidgeted with Django for the first time.
### Week Four: I created the design layout inside of Django.
### Week Five: I created the functionality to sign in, sign up, and log out.
### Week six: I began connecting my Django project to MySQL. I ended up getting stumped on an error, which I was able to fix by changing the project's encoding to UTF-8.
